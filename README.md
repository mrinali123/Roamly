# Roamly

**AI-powered travel itinerary planner** — describe your trip once and get a fully structured day-by-day plan with real places, optimal timing, restaurant picks, weather forecasts, and a built-in budget tracker.

Built as a solo full-stack project to explore LLM-driven UX: the interesting challenge was making AI output reliable enough to drive a real UI — parsing streaming JSON, handling model rate limits gracefully, and keeping the experience fast even when generation takes time.

## Features

- **AI itinerary generation** — Groq-powered, streams progress in real time; respects arrival/departure times, pace preference, budget, interests, dietary needs, and must-visit places
- **Day-by-day view** — per-day weather forecast, sightseeing places with GPS coordinates and timing rationale, restaurant picks, and quick tips
- **Interactive map** — Leaflet map with pins for every place across the itinerary
- **Budget tracker** — log expenses by category, visualize spending with charts
- **Trip sharing** — public share link or email-invite collaborators
- **AI chat assistant** — ask questions about your trip, get suggestions, iterate on plans
- **PDF export** — download the full itinerary as a formatted PDF
- **Offline support** — PWA with localStorage cache; saved trips work without internet
